config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  'conservative' - this driver is rather similar to the 'ondemand'

	  its optimisation for better suitability in a battery powered

	  If you have a desktop machine then you should really be considering
	  the 'ondemand' governor instead, however if you are using a laptop,
	  PDA or even an AMD64 based computer (due to the unacceptable
	  step-by-step latency issues between the minimum and maximum frequency
	  transitions in the CPU) you will probably want to use this governor.
